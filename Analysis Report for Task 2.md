# Boosting Chip Sales: Unveiling the Game-Changing Impact of Trial Layouts in Stores with Data-Driven Analysis

## Introduction
The task was to examine the performance of trial stores compared to control stores for the Category Manager for Chips. The objective was to test the impact of new trial layouts and provide a data-driven recommendation on whether to roll out the trial layout to all stores.
The analysis was conducted using R as the primary tool.

## Insight and Recommendation
Control stores were selected based on their similarity to the trial stores in terms of monthly overall sales revenue, number of customers, and number of transactions per customer.
Trial store 77 showed a significant increase in sales during the trial period compared to its control store.
Trial store 86 had a significant increase in the number of customers during the trial period but no significant difference in sales compared to its control store.
Trial store 88 showed a significant increase in sales during the trial period compared to its control store.
Based on the data-driven analysis, it is recommended to implement the trial layout in all stores.
Store 77 and store 88 exhibited positive impacts on sales during the trial period.

## Conclusion
The performance of trial stores was assessed compared to their respective control stores.
Store 86's results need to be verified with the Category Manager to confirm any potential factors affecting the sales outcome.
Overall, the trial layouts demonstrated a positive impact on sales, particularly in stores 77 and 88.
